                Speaking at India’s first International GenAI Conclave in Kochi Thursday, which was inaugurated by Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, Smith, a veteran of four space flights covering 16 million miles and seven spacewalks, praised India’s Mars Orbiter Mission (2013-14), known as Mangalyaan. <br> <br>
                
                “It was the first time a country ever made it successfully to another planet on first attempt. All of you should be proud of it,” said Smith during a session ‘Lessons Learned from A Skywalker’.</p>

            <h3 class="newsTitle">Meet Phenomenal AI, the first made in India text to video generator platform</h3>
            <p class="newsText">With increasing demand for video content, online video traffic is estimated to account for almost 74 per cent of all internet traffic by the end of the year. To address these challenges and make video generation tools available for all, an Indian startup recently unveiled Phenomenal AI, India’s first text-to-video generator.
<br><br>
                Compared to traditional forms of video production, which usually requires a lot of time resources and money, the company says its AI-powered text-to-video generator has several tools that let users create professional-looking videos using text as input. Phenomenal AI says its intuitive interface eliminates the technical complexities and lets users generate high-quality videos “in a fraction of the time compared to traditional methods.”
                <br><br>
                The text-to-video generator can also help eliminate the cost of expensive equipment, crews and locations and help generate a “high volume of videos effortlessly.” The tool also offers several styles, music, voiceovers, and scenes to select from, which might make it the go-to tool for content creators.</p>

            <h3 class="newsTitle">EU accepts Apple pledge to let rivals access ‘tap to pay’ iPhone tech to resolve antitrust case</h3>
            <p class="newsText">The European Union says it’s accepting Apple’s pledge to open up its “tap to pay” iPhone payment system to rivals as a way to resolve an antitrust case and head off a hefty fine.
<br> <br>
                The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, said Thursday that it’s accepting the commitments that Apple offered earlier this year and will make them legally binding.
                <br> <br>
                The Commission had accused Apple in 2022 of abusing its dominant position by limiting access to its mobile payment technology.
                <br> <br>
                Apple responded by proposing in January to allow third-party mobile wallet and payment service providers access to the contactless payment function in its iOS operating system.
                <br> <br>
                After Apple tweaked its proposals following testing and feedback, the Commission said it “concluded that Apple’s final commitments would address its competition concerns.”</p>

            <h5>Rs. 99,999</h5>
            <p class="newsText">For years, I have struggled to adapt to foldable phones as a consumer. Honestly, I tried to ignore the familiar flaws I found with every new foldable phone, yet I was never able to give up my iPhone at any point in time. However, using the new Motorola Razr 50 Ultra (sold as Razr Plus in the US) felt different, and I felt more confident handling a foldable phone in my day-to-day life. <br> <br>
                It’s a nice change, and my admission may be a sign that foldable smartphones can be relied upon despite the ifs and buts they come with like any other new product category. But the question remains: is it worth investing in something like a Motorola Razr foldable phone over a standard smartphone? Yes and no; it depends on a lot of factors. Here is my review of the Motorola Razr 50 Ultra. <br> <br>
                On the surface, though very much like last year’s model, the new Razr is a flip-style foldable phone that you and I are familiar with. When unfolded flat, there’s a nominal crease in the display in the middle that I didn’t notice when looking at it or running my finger over the screen, but it’s there for sure. The phone closes with a snap, and when unfolded, the two halves come together and seamlessly blend over the hinge cover. <br> </p>

            <p class="newsText">Amazon.com opens new tab announced a series of largely incremental refinements on Wednesday to several of its artificial intelligence products as it seeks to keep rivals at bay amid a continued investor frenzy over the technology.
<br> <br>
                The retailer has sought to counter a perception that competitors Google opens new tab, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab and OpenAI have taken a lead in developing generative AI, which can respond almost instantaneously with full sentences or pictures to complicated prompts or queries.
                <br> <br>
                The improvements Amazon announced at its conference in New York include adding additional memory to so-called agents that automate work for businesses, so that each new request can build on prior ones, said Vasi Philomin, Amazon’s vice president of generative AI.
                <br> <br>
                “This allows agents to provide more personalized and more seamless experiences, especially for complicated tasks,” said Philomin in an interview Tuesday.
                <br><br>
                He said, for instance, that the updated AI agents could remember for each subsequent request that a user prefers aisle or window seats on a flight, which was not previously possible.</p>

            <h3 class="newsTitle">Apple warns iPhone users in India, 97 other countries of Pegasus-like spyware attack</h3>
            <p class="newsText">Apple has once again issued a new round of warnings for iPhone users in 98 countries including India, warning them that they might potentially be targeted by a Pegasus like spyware. Earlier this year in April, the Cupertino-based tech giant sent a similar notification to users across 92 nations.
<br> <br>
                According to a support document on the Apple website, the company has been regularly informing iPhone users across 150 countries worldwide about these types of attacks. However, the latest notification did not disclose the attacker’s identities and the list of countries where users received the alert.
                <br> <br>
                “Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-. This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously,” Apple wrote in the new alert.
                 <br> <br>
                “Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware. These attacks cost millions of dollars and are individually deployed against a very small number of people, but the targeting is ongoing and global,” said the notification.</p>

<br> <br>
                The comments by Amit Zavery came after Microsoft reached a deal with trade body CISPE to resolve the latter’s antitrust complaint about its cloud licensing practices.
                <br> <br>
                “Many regulatory bodies have opened inquiries into Microsoft’s licensing practices, and we are hopeful there will be remedies to protect the cloud market from Microsoft’s anti-competitive behavior,” he said. <br> <br>
                “We are exploring our options to continue to fight against Microsoft’s anti-competitive licensing in order to promote choice, innovation, and the growth of the digital economy in Europe.”</p>

            <p class="newsText">Microsoft has ditched the board observer seat at OpenAI that has drawn regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, saying it was not necessary after the AI start-up’s governance had improved significantly in the past eight months.
<br> <br>
                Apple, which last month announced bringing OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT to its devices, would not take the observer role on OpenAI’s board after being widely expected to do so, the Financial Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
                <br> <br>
                An OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.
                <br> <br>
                Microsoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI’s board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.</p>

            <p class="newsText">Instagram boss Adam Mosseri recently posted a video saying the platform won’t focus on long-form content. While users can share hour-long videos, he says that it might “undermine” the social media network’s “core identity to connect people with friends.”
<br> <br>
                Mosseri, who is also responsible for Threads went on to say that a creator recently asked him if the platform will be doing long-form videos, to which his answer was no. He explained that while Instagram does a lot of things, the social media network has two goals – connecting people with their friends and helping them explore interests “usually through shortform video.” and that these things are “symbiotic.”</p>

            <p class="newsText">Global shipments of personal computers rose by 3% in the second quarter, helped by demand for AI-capable devices, with Apple seeing the biggest growth among PC makers, preliminary data from research firm IDC showed on Tuesday. <br> <br>

                PC shipments reached 64.9 million units in the three months ended June, marking a second straight quarter of growth after two years of decline, the report said. <br> <br>
                According to IDC, Apple’s shipments jumped 20.8% from the second quarter of 2023, the biggest rise among global PC makers, followed by a gain of 13.7% by Acer Group.
                <br> <br>
                The market for PCs is expected to rebound from a lull in orders following the pandemic-driven buying spree.
                <br> <br>
                Two consecutive quarters of growth, the market hype around artificial intelligence PCs and a commercial refresh cycle seem to be what the PC market needed, said Ryan Reith, group vice president at IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers.
                <br> <br>
                “The buzz is clearly around AI, but a lot is happening with non-AI PC purchasing to make this mature market show signs of positivity.”</p>
